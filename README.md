# wpms-activity-register

Our goal is to record per-site and per-site-user statistics in a WordPress Multisite configuration so that we can quantify user participation and eventually use it as a way to offer reports on a per-site, per-user, and per-site-per-user basis, and automated recognition (e.g. microcourse open badges).

This plug-in creates a new registry table for storing activity data.

This plug-in is the work of the Open Education Resource Foundation on behalf of the OERuniversitas (http://oeru.org). We are using WordPress to deliver open courses (using exclusively openly licensed (CC-By or CC-By-SA) course materials) assembled by our partners on one of our other initiatives: http://wikieducator.org You (and your institution) are also welcome to use these materials, and are invited to consider becoming OERu partners!
